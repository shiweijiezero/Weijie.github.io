Here is Weijie Shi (Jason Haggard).

I am a second year postgraduate in **Computer Science and Technology** at Soochow University (Suzhou, China) with GPA 3.8/4.0. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Jiajie Xu](http://web.suda.edu.cn/xujj/).

Research Interests
======
**Key words: machine learning on applications, spatial and temporal data, LLM, knowledge extraction** 

My previous research focuses on practical problems that artificial intelligence faces in real life. My interests are on the **Machine Learning** and its applications in **Traffic System** (such as map-matching, trajectory similarity computation). In a word, advanced technologies like ML and Traffic System positively influence the life of everybody (e.g. security tracking, traffic management, etc.).

Recently, with the booming development of **large language models (LLMs)**, we have been amazed to witness the barriers between machines and natural languages being broken down. Many fascinating projects have utilized LLMs as controllers to create powerful automated and integrated tools (such as HuggingGPT, Visual ChatGPT, AutoGPT, ToolFormer). The combination of various tools with LLMs has led to a further burst of vitality. However, the fatal flaw of LLMs is their inability to guarantee trustworthy responses. **Extracting knowledge from the internet, storing knowledge in a structured manner, and indexing knowledge to assist large models** will greatly enhance the LLMs' ability to understand and express knowledge. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.

2. Experiential with integrated learning frameworks: XGboost, Catboost, and LightGBM.
3. Proficient of languages: Python, Pytorch.
4. Slightly understanding of tools: Pytorch Lightning, Scala, Spark, Docker.
5. Used tools: Docker, Neo4j, C++, Java, Tensorflow, Keras, C#, Vue, Tornado/Flask, Bash.
