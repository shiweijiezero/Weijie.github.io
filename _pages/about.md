Here is Weijie Shi (Jason, 史伟杰).

I am a second year postgraduate in **Computer Science and Technology** at Soochow University (Suzhou, China). I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Jiajie Xu](http://web.suda.edu.cn/xujj/). And my GPA is 3.8/4.0.

Research Interests
======
My previous research focuses on practical problems that artificial intelligence faces in real life. My interests are on the **Machine Learning** and its applications in **Traffic System** (such as map-matching, trajectory similarity computation). In a word, advanced technologies like ML and Traffic System positively influence the life of everybody (e.g. security tracking, traffic management, etc.).

Recently, with the booming development of **large language models (LLMs)**, we have been amazed to witness the barriers between machines and natural languages being broken down. Many fascinating projects have utilized LLMs as controllers to create powerful automated and integrated tools (such as HuggingGPT, Visual ChatGPT, AutoGPT, ToolFormer). The combination of various tools with LLMs has led to a further burst of vitality. However, the fatal flaw of LLMs is their inability to guarantee trustworthy responses. **Extracting knowledge from the internet, storing knowledge in a structured manner, and indexing knowledge to assist large models** will greatly enhance the LLMs' ability to understand and express knowledge. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.

Personal Skills
===========
I understand and apply mainstream deep learning methods (Transformer, Diffusion, RL, GAN, VAE, CNN, RNN, GCN), integrated learning frameworks (XGboost, Catboost, LightGBM), and tools (Neo4j, Pytorch, Scala, Spark and Docker). I have good engineering skills and scientific research intuition. 

What'more, I also skilled of feature engineering techniques, has participated in the Tianchi competition and achieved a ranking of 6/670. 
In Huawei's road network matching project for cellular trajectories with high positioning, I achieved engineering and improved matching accuracy, and ultimately completed the project and applied it to a certain mobile operator.
