Here is Weijie Shi (Jason, 史伟杰).

I am a second year postgraduate in **Computer Science and Technology** at Soochow University (Suzhou, China) with GPA 3.8/4.0. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Jiajie Xu](http://web.suda.edu.cn/xujj/).

Research Interests
======
My previous research focuses on practical problems that artificial intelligence faces in real life. My interests are on the **Machine Learning** and its applications in **Traffic System** (such as map-matching, trajectory similarity computation). In a word, advanced technologies like ML and Traffic System positively influence the life of everybody (e.g. security tracking, traffic management, etc.).

Recently, with the booming development of **large language models (LLMs)**, we have been amazed to witness the barriers between machines and natural languages being broken down. Many fascinating projects have utilized LLMs as controllers to create powerful automated and integrated tools (such as HuggingGPT, Visual ChatGPT, AutoGPT, ToolFormer). The combination of various tools with LLMs has led to a further burst of vitality. However, the fatal flaw of LLMs is their inability to guarantee trustworthy responses. **Extracting knowledge from the internet, storing knowledge in a structured manner, and indexing knowledge to assist large models** will greatly enhance the LLMs' ability to understand and express knowledge. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.

Personal Skills
===========
I am proficient in the application and understanding of mainstream deep learning methods including but not limited to Transformer, Diffusion, RL, GAN, VAE, CNN, RNN, and GCN. I have extensive experience with integrated learning frameworks such as XGboost, Catboost, and LightGBM. I am also adept at using tools like Neo4j, Pytorch, Scala, Spark, and Docker. My engineering skills are well-honed and complemented by a strong intuition for scientific research.

Moreover, I excel in feature engineering techniques. My proficiency in this area has been demonstrated through my participation in the Tianchi competition, where I secured a commendable ranking of 6 out of 670.

In my work on Huawei's road network matching project, I effectively managed map-matching for high-positioning cellular trajectories. My contributions led to significant improvements in matching accuracy. This project was ultimately completed successfully and implemented by a notable mobile operator. I take pride in my capability to drive projects from conception through to application.
