Step1:
I used python to reproduce the SOTA HMM-based map-matching algorithm for cellular trajectories.
The SOTA paper refers to [ST-Matching](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/map-matching-for-low-sampling-rate-gps-trajectories/), [SnapNet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7539689/) 

Step2:
I transformed these code into spark+scala big-data architecture.
